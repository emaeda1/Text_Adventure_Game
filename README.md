This is my first ever coding project written with Python using JuypterNotebook (October 2021).
All code is in a single cell.

**What I learned to utilize:**
- Strings and String Manipulation
- DocString
- f'string
- User-Defined Functions and Objects using variables (fail()function)
- User Input Handling
- Loops (For/While)
- Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (If/Elif/Else)
- Exception (Try/Except)
